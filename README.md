### Note from the maintainer:
This is a personal project that I have wanted to create after my search for open-source/free software to do these tasks was almost non-excistent or didn't function well. I hope that you can get use from my projects, or I can serve you using my software. 

#### Repository Information
You are the .NET development repository for RaceReg. RaceReg orginally started as a Java GUI applicaiton, but after I gained more experience in C# and other .NET technologies I decided to move development to .NET.

* WPF Application (Windows)
